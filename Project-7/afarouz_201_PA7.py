The try/except ensures that a feesible file is used. If the file is not found
then the function will return 'File Not Found.

The first three lines under the try statement open the file and iterates
through each line of the file. The first line under the for loop splits each
individual line into a list.

The if statement checks if that specific line's name is the same as the input
name. If it is, the precinct is stored in prec and then the loop is broken
and the name with the corresponding precinct is returned

The initial for loop and the two lines above iterare through each line in the
spreadsheet. The nested for loops go through each character in the name of
the line and removes the characters which are in the initially defined list
'remove'.

The second set of nested for loops capitalizes each element in new line in
order for it to match the proper output.

The final if statement returns the precinct, the polling place, the address,
and the city.

The initial for loop and the two lines above iterare through each line in the
spreadsheet. The first for loop assigns the correct amount of keys for each
city in the spreadsheet and each key is assigmed to an empty list.

The second for loop takes each precinct and adds it to the list which is
assigned to the corresponding city of that precinct.

The last for loop adds the number of precincts each city has to the end of
each respective list, and finally, the dictionary is returned.

The initial for loop goes through each 3rd element in the list starting at the
3rd element.

The try statement has an if/else statement which checks if the length of the
zip code is not 5 digits. If it is not 5 digits, the zip code is stored as 0.

The except statement checks if there was a potential value error in the input
for the participation rate. If there is an error, the participation rate is
stored as 0.
